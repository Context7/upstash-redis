  - Ordered execution of workflow runs.
- Expand language support with additional SDKs: Go and other languages based on user requests.
- Achieve feature parity between `workflow-py` and `workflow-js`, bringing Python SDK capabilities up to match TypeScript implementation
- Human in the loop in [the Agents API](/workflow/agents/overview).
- Improve the [verbose mode and logger](/workflow/basics/serve#verbose).
